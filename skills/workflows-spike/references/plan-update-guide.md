# Plan Update Guide

When a spike concludes, propose updates to the plan based on what was learned. The plan must be self-sufficient — capture full rationale, not just pointers to the spike doc.

## Update Mapping

| What changed | Plan update |
|---|---|
| Requirement validated | Note increased confidence, no change needed unless wording should be more specific |
| Requirement changed | Update wording and priority. Full rationale in the plan: what was tried, why it changed. Link to spike doc for traceability. |
| New requirement discovered | Add to acceptance criteria with appropriate priority. Note discovered during spike. |
| Scope boundary confirmed or shifted | Update scope section with rationale. |
| New decision made | Add to technical considerations or proposed solution with rationale. |
| Direction invalidated | Flag for user — this is a significant plan change. See `edge-cases.md` for handling direction invalidation. |
| Open question resolved | Remove from open questions. Rationale captured in the affected section. |

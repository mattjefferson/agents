## Core Principles (Elements of Style)

### Composition
- **Rule 10: Active voice** — Direct and vigorous. Passive weakens.
- **Rule 11: Positive form** — Assert; don't hedge. "Did not remember" → "forgot"
- **Rule 12: Concrete language** — Specific beats general. Facts beat abstractions.
- **Rule 13: Omit needless words** — Every word must earn its place.
- **Rule 18: Emphatic words at end** — Sentence stress falls on the final position.

### Structure
- **Rule 8: One paragraph, one topic** — Examine for subdivision after writing.
- **Rule 9: Topic sentence first** — Reader knows purpose immediately.
- **Rule 15: Parallel construction** — Similar ideas in similar form.
- **Rule 16: Related words together** — Proximity shows relationship.

### Mechanics
- **Rule 5: No comma splices** — Independent clauses need semicolon or conjunction.
- **Rule 7: Dangling modifiers** — Opening phrase must refer to grammatical subject.

### Red-Flag Phrases (delete or rewrite)
- "stands/serves as a testament"
- "plays a vital/significant/crucial role"
- "rich/vibrant tapestry"
- "nestled in the heart of"
- "groundbreaking", "intricate"
- "enduring/lasting legacy"
- "it's important to note/remember"
- "In summary", "In conclusion", "Overall"

### Structural Tells
- [ ] Trailing -ing phrases ("...highlighting its significance")
- [ ] Rule-of-three padding ("experts, professionals, and specialists")
- [ ] "Despite its [positive], faces challenges..." formula
- [ ] "Not only... but also..." overuse
- [ ] Em-dash overuse for emphasis
- [ ] Every section ends with significance claim

### Voice Problems
- [ ] Abstract subjects doing human actions ("The study highlights...")
- [ ] Weasel attributions ("observers have noted", "critics argue")
- [ ] Hedging ("may vary", "might be considered")
- [ ] False ranges ("from X to Y" where X and Y aren't on a scale)

### Quick Fixes
| AI Pattern | Human Alternative |
|------------|-------------------|
| "plays a crucial role in" | delete, or be specific |
| "rich tapestry of" | delete |
| "nestled in" | "located in" or just name the place |
| "It's important to note" | delete; just state the fact |
| "highlighting/underscoring" | delete the whole phrase |
| "continues to captivate" | delete or cite evidence |

# Slash Commands

Slash commands are reusable prompt templates that live in `~/.codex/prompts/` (global) and, when present, in repo-local folders (e.g., `.claude/commands/`, `.cursor/commands/`). This folder mirrors the global set so agents can discover and edit them in-repo.


See the individual files in this directory for details.

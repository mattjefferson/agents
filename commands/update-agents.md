description: Update AGENTS.md
argument-hint: "[findings list or source type]"
---

When I use this command, update the project's `AGENTS.md` with the key information we just discussed.

Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake from happening again. The rules must:
- Be specific and actionable (avoid vague guidance).
- Tie directly to the findings or source given in the argument.
- Match the tone and structure of `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep changes minimal and relevant to the new guidance only.

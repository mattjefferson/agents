description: Create beads from a plan
argument-hint: "[plan]"
---

Take this plan and create a comprehensive, granular set of beads with tasks, subtasks, and dependency structure. 

Make it totally self-contained and self-documenting with detailed comments covering:
- Relevant background and context
- Reasoning and justification for each task
- Key considerations and constraints
- How each piece serves the overarching project goals
- Anything our "future self" would need to know about goals, intentions, and thought process

Structure the output as a proper beads with clear task hierarchy and dependencies defined

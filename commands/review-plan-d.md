description: Review plan for best revisions
argument-hint: "[path to plan file]"

Carefully review this entire plan for me and come up with your best revisions in terms of better architecture, new features, changed features, etc. to make it better, more robust/reliable, more performant, more compelling/useful, etc.

For each proposed change, give me your detailed analysis and rationale/justification for why it would make the project better along with the git-diff style change versus the original plan shown.

Finally, Ask me if I want you to edit the plan directory or create another file with your findings.

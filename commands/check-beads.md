description: Check beads and optimize
argument-hint: "[optional: specific principle to audit]"

Check over each bead for this project super carefully-- are you sure it makes sense? Is it optimal? Could we change anything to make the system work better for users? 

If so, revise the beads. It's a lot easier and faster to operate in "plan space" before we start implementing these things!

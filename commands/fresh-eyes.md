description: Look at the plan with fresh eyes
argument-hint: [optional: plan document]

Reread AGENTS.md so it's still fresh in your mind. Great, now I want you to carefully read over the ENTIRE plan document, but this time with "fresh eyes," looking super carefully for any errors, mistakes, problems, issues, confusion, conceptual errors, logical violations, ignoring of probability theory, sloppy thinking, inaccurate information/data, bad implicit assumptions, etc. Carefully fix anything you uncover by revising the plan document in-place in a series of small edits, not one big edit.
